As a user, I want to be presented with a choice of three different images of randomly selected products out of a pool of 20 images that are potential gadgets someonne would purchase.
As a user, after I select an image, I would like my selection of product and number of selections or items clicked recorded.

As a user, after I make a selection from the three images, I would like to be presented a new selection of three images.
As a user, the next three images that appear I would like to see no duplicates, nor no duplicates in the next 3 images that appear.
As a user, I would like to be prompted to view my results in the form of a bar graph or list, after voting on images 25 times.
As a user, I would like to be prompted to reset the entire exercise after viewing the results.
As a user, I would like to see a header of the Buss-mall and a shadow box effect on each image.
As a user, I would like the images to be centered inside the bounding box.
As a user, I would like all bounding boxes to be the same size, horizontally aligned, and equidistance apart.
As a user, I would like to see a creative layout and style presented
